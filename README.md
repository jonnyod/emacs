# emacs
This emacs config is a mash-up of Tudho's Helm set-up and C++ ide (see https://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html) and Sarcasm's irony mode, flycheck, company-irony (see https://github.com/Sarcasm).

Please see the aforementioned repos for tutorials and/or installation instructions - this is especially true for M-x package installations for Sarcasm's irony mode.
